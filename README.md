Pieces of code for my A-level coursework that I have deemed "complete"  
My project is on generating Voronoi diagrams with the Delaunay triangulation, Green and Sibson algorithm and Fortune's algorithm in C# with Unity although I am first prototyping each method in python  
Delaunay code: delaunay2.py just generates a Voronoi diagram from a set of points outputting a set of GeoGebra segments while incrementalDelaunay.py generates a diagram then adds some points to it using a reasonably efficient diagram update method and outputs with matplotlib  
Fortune code: fortune2.py generates a Voronoi diagram from a set of points outputting a set of GeoGebra segments although the unbounded edges are printed twice

The actual unity project is in a different repo for syncronisation reasons

I've also attached the most recent version of my Report as you may find that enlightening as to what on earth this is about
